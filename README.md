Hi, 
this is just a simple Youtube Video downloader powered by Tkinter and Ffmpeg huge s/o (www.ffmpeg.org).

# 1. Step
  Install the latest version of python (viz www.python.org/downloads/)
  
  And download ffmpeg (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/) choose "ffmpeg-N-103359-g0383ec88a5-win64-gpl.zip" 
# 2. Download
  Download the code as .zip file and export it into a folder. 
  
  Now you need to add the folder "ffmpeg" into your path. 
  
  If you know how, you can skip the 3rd Step. 
# 3. Adding to Path  
  Search for System environment variables like you see on the picture

  Then click "Environment Variables..." (bottom-right).

  Now doubleclick "Path"
  (I recommend moving ffmpeg folder to your C: drive).
  
  And add the location of "ffmpeg\bin" to the Path.

  Click Ok everywhere.  :)
